* Original design by Andreas [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cc-7576/6748547019/).

Part count: 464
Project time: 22.5hrs.

(Project time includes all related activities: digital design, part ordering, building, photographing, and sharing)

### Using Stud.io for the first time
This was my first project done using BrickLink's new Stud.io editor instead of LDD. The added features in Stud.io are just amazing!

Here are my favorite features:

* It puts a little warning sign on any pieces that don’t actually exist in the color you chose.
* It allows you to create submodels
   * This lets you focus in on one portion at a time.
   * It makes it easy to select and move entire subcomponents.
   * You can copy submodels and have them linked--changing one changes them all.
* It has rendering built in!!! 
* For any piece you're using, you can click the part number to be taken directly to its page on BrickLink
   * It would be nice if you could add the part directly to your wanted list from within stud.io, but oh well, it’s good enough!

### Design process
Because this model isn't overly huge, I actually had most of the parts needed (just not always in the right color). This helped a lot because it meant I could actually work on the digital design and the physical one at the same time. Sometimes it's just easier to figure out how something should go together when you have the bricks in your hands.

As I built it (using whatever colored pieces I could find), I would add parts to my BrickLink wanted list that were the correct color, or that I was running low on, or that were too scratched up to use in the final model.

By the time I was done, I had a pretty thorough list of the parts I needed. This let me rely on BrickLink's new shopping wizard to automatically find a good combination of stores to buy everything on my list.

### Build notes / TODOs

*Side Hatches*

Right now, the light gray side panels are actually attached with hinges, with the intention being that you could open them to reveal some circuitry or what have you. But the panels bump into the wings, so they won't actually open! I'd like to play with the design some more to see if I can't remedy that.

*Cockpit Gap*

I'm not 100% happy with the gap between the cockpit and the main fuselage. I could probably make some tweaks to better hide that space.
