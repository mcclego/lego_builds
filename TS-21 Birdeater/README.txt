So you're planning to build the Birdeater, that's awesome! I've tried 
hard to make it relatively painless, but you should read this first for some
important notes.

Thoughts & Review of the Build
==============================
As I'm sure you'd agree from the pictures, this is an epic build! The amount 
of interesting detail is just awesome. It comes to a grand total of 1,341 
bricks!

Some things you should know, however, if you plan to build it. The legs are 
pretty sturdy, but not up to the standards of an official Lego build. It 
doesn't take too much pressure to cause this thing to collapse, and the legs
need to be positioned relatively precisely to make the tank stable. All this
means that it's not a great model for play. You can set it up to look awesome,
but you're not going to move it around a lot. 

The turret is a similar story. Again, it's pretty robust, but not to the
standards of an official Lego set. Some of the connections in the guns are 
relatively fragile.

Description of Directories
==========================
[BrickLink Order]           Contains the XML file for the BrickLink wanted list
                            and the LDD file that was used to generate it.
[Buildable Components]      Contains the LDD designs for the tank, broken down
                            into manageable subcomponents.
[Original Images]           Contains all of the photos from the original 
                            designer https://www.flickr.com/photos/legorobo/
                            as well as some of the early renders I shared on
                            my Flickr.

Ordering Parts
==============
You can use the XML upload feature of BrickLink to import the wanted list I 
generated. First, create a new Wanted list in your account, then open the file
'BrickLink Order/TS-21_Birdeater_Wanted_List.xml' and replace all occurrences
of the text "REPLACEME" with the ID of your wanted list.

Then just copy and paste the XML into the form here:
http://www.bricklink.com/wantedXML.asp

Assembling The Sub-Components
=============================
I divided the LDD file up into subcomponents so that you could use the building
guide mode of LDD more effectively. You can build the different subcomponents
in whatever order you'd like, but you'll want to assemble them in the order I 
describe here.

First, build the body without the legs or turret. Assemble them in the
following order: (1) Cockpit, (2) Frame, (3) Nose, (4) Top Deck.

Don't forget the five turntable tops. LDD doesn't have a separate part for
the round turntable inserts (though Bricklink does). You'll just have to 
place these by looking at the pictures--there are two on the undercarriage, 
two on the back access doors, and one on top of the engine.

Next you'll add the legs. Do this with the body upside down, and the legs up
in the air. You'll want to position the legs carefully so that the tank will
be stable--you can look at the photos as a reference.

Next you'll add the turret. You're going to want to hold the tank by the body
while you attach the turret, rather than standing the tank up first. If you
try to stand it up, then attach the turret, the legs will likely bend and/or
break from the pressure. I warned you the legs are a little flimsy! :)

With the whole thing assembled, now you can place it on a surface carefully,
watching to make sure the legs stay in the best shape.   


Additions And Modifications to the Bricklink Order
==================================================
In order to generate the BrickLink wanted list, I used BrickUtils to convert
the LDD file 'TS-21 Birdeater - Combined (For Ordering & Rendering).lxf'.

After that, I made some modifications to the parts list as described below.

- The build includes a lot of dark grey 2 x 2 round plates. In LDD, it uses
  BrickLink part number 4032b, but 4032 looks the same and is much easier to
  find, so I changed it to 4032 in the wanted list (there are also a few red,
  white, and green ones that I changed as well).
- The Technic pin connector (looks like a tube) in LDD is BrickLink part 
  number 75535. The slotted version of this tube, BrickLink part number 62462
  is more common, so I changed it to 62462 in the wanted list. This is for the
  four white tubes under the engine, and for the two red tubs on the underside.
- The tank includes 5 turntable tops. LDD doesn't have a separate part for just
  the turntable top (only the assembled turntable), but BrickLink does. So I
  manually added 5 turntable tops to the wanted list.
- I manually added 50cm string (x77ac50) and the hook with towball (30395).
  BrickLink has a catalog entry for the complete assembly, but the individual
  parts appear to be easier to find.
