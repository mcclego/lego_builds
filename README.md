# lego_builds
Lego digital design files for various builds.

I've developed a hobby of replicating my most favorite Lego creations from the many awesome builders out there on Flickr. 

I specifically pick models that seem well photographed from multiple angles. From there, I'll start to re-create them in a digital designer (I'm currently using Stud.io from BrickLink!). Once I've got a reasonable replica, I order the parts, and finish refining the design with the actual bricks in hand.
