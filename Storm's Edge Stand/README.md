I've finished an initial revision of the stand Nick Trotta built for [Storm's Edge](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tardisblue/25905450946/). 

Obviously the *ship* is the real star of the show, but I'd like to use the stand to display a couple other ships I have, and thought other people might value the design.

I didn't have very detailed images to work off of, so it's not as close of a replica as my other digital designs. In particular I know Nick's stand has a little more going on in the center of the base.

Next step is to order some parts and build it, and work out any final kinks in the design!
